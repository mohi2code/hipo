React specific Requirements:
  - I need a router. React Router DOM.
  - I need something for API calls. fetch api.
  - I need something for caching. Two options, Local storage (HDD) or react custom hooks (RAM).
  - Custom components.

Edge Use Cases:
  - User submitted an empty text field.
  - User didn't provide @ symbol in input text field.
  - Profile Not found - 404.

Github API Behavior:
  - When entering an invalid username or non-existant one the response is 404, not found
  - When a user doesn't have repos the response is 200 and data array is empty.
  - When requesting repos with pagination you will recieve a link header that includes all the links, page_numbers, etc.
